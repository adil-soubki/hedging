4248,Magda,A: It does make a difference like I always thought formula smells kind of disgusting {inhale},98
4248,Magda,B: oh yeah.,99
4248,Magda,A: Like when they throw up it smells disgusting and when they make their little doo-doo’s it smells grosser if they’re on formula. But if they’re totally breast milk now you’ll find this hard this believe but if they’re totally breast milk for like the first couple months --,100
4248,Magda,B: mhm.,101
4248,Magda,A: they don’t their number twos don’t smell at all.,102

4248,Magda,A: it looks like shit but it doesn’t smell like anything {laugh}.,105
4248,Magda,B: oh okay.,106
4248,Magda,B: {inhale}And did you pump or not?,107
4248,Magda,A: yeah I pumped. What joy that was.,108
4248,Magda,B: Did you use a manual or a %uh did you get one of those little battery ones?,109

4248,Magda,A: Battery operated deal.,111
4248,Magda,B: yeah. I think so too.,112
4248,Magda,A: Now like I can tell you I can find the exact brand name of it if you want some time.,113
4248,Magda,B: {breath},114
4248,Magda,A: But like it had like this little like nozzle attachment thing on it which was what it said you were supposed to use.,115
4248,Magda,B: mhm.,116
4248,Magda,B: mhm.,117
4248,Magda,A: And I used it the first time for like three seconds I was like --,118

4248,Magda,B: {laugh},120

4248,Magda,B: {laugh},122
4248,Magda,A: {inhale} Don’t ever do that again.,123
4248,Magda,A: And I forget what it said it was for I think it said it was for if you had small breasts or something. I don’t know what,124
4248,Magda,B: oh okay.,125
4248,Magda,A: so like I took that thing and I threw it away. {laugh},126
4248,Magda,B: {laugh},127
4248,Magda,A: {inhale} It was like a little part you put on top of a nozzle thing. It was just like an extra attachment and I took that and I --,128
4248,Magda,B: ((mhm)) okay [distorted].,129
4248,Magda,A: -- threw it away,130
4248,Magda,B: okay.,131
4248,Magda,A: And then it was fine.,132
4248,Magda,B: okay.,133
4248,Magda,A: So.,134
4248,Magda,B: yeah.,135
4248,Magda,A: That seemed to work fine {inhale},136

4248,Magda,A: you know,139

4248,Magda,B: yeah.,143
4248,Magda,A: Not do this whole pumping thing I mean if I had to do it all over that’s what I would do.,144
4248,Magda,B: oh yeah because I was thinking it would be easier because then other people could feed the baby and you wouldn’t have to be so tied to it.,145
4248,Magda,A: (( )),146
4248,Magda,A: yeah. And if you want to go out to a movie or something.,147
4248,Magda,A: Mean that you know ((did you)),148

4248,Magda,A: mhm.,152
4248,Magda,B: It would be so nice to just you know leave the baby with them but you can’t leave the baby.,153
4248,Magda,"A: yeah. I mean if you,",154
4248,Magda,A: you know y- you might have to try one or two before you find one that works but,155

4248,Magda,B: {laugh},164
4248,Magda,A: or obscene or something.,165
4248,Magda,A: But once you get used to it it was %uh you know you can like read while you’re doing it. It was like boring.,166
4248,Magda,B: uh-huh.,167
4248,Magda,B: okay.,168
4248,Magda,B: And what does it go into like a little plastic bag **thingy**?,169

4248,Magda,B: {breath},175
4248,Magda,B: okay. And you can reuse the plastic container?,176

4310,Magda,B: (( )) Do you remember &Otto who moved my filing cabinet that time in &Philadelphia he’s another one?,151
4310,Magda,A: Yes. uh-huh.,152

4310,Magda,B: He’s sort of very solid and they (( )) just love it [distortion].,156
4310,Magda,A: But &Robert’s not big like that.,157
4310,Magda,"B: No, but he, but &Robert is big below the elbows I’ll bet if you check.",158
4310,Magda,A: {laugh} I’ll have to check out below &Robert’s elbows {laugh},159
4310,Magda,B: {laugh},160
4310,Magda,"A: At any rate, %um",161
4310,Magda,"A: So that was nice and then we watched through the nursery while they do,",162
4310,Magda,A: if you survive the first four hours of life in the nursery you’ll survive anything after.  It’s the most sort of appalling introduction to life.,163
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,164
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,165
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,166
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,167
4310,Magda,A: But I was kind of scared at that point because we’re looking in and there’re all these nice sweet little pale babies lying there limp,168
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,169
4310,Magda,A: and there’s &Mae and she’s big compared to the rest and she was bright red and she is screaming and she screamed and she screamed and she screamed and all the rest of them as soon as they,170
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,171
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,172
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh. ((Um-huh)) [distortion],173
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh,174
4310,Magda,A: they sort of get exhausted after two screams and collapse.,175
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,176
4310,Magda,A: And she was healthy I guess.,177
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh {laugh}.,178
4310,Magda,A: And she just screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and I thought oh my god what have we wrought here. {laugh},179
4310,Magda,B: Did they tell you her ((apgar)) or whatever they call that?,180
4310,Magda,A: How (( )),181
4310,Magda,"A: They didn’t tell us anything.  In fact, at the hospital they weren’t",182
4310,Magda,"A: the, there were someth-, the individual people we had contact with were, were decent to us and friendly",183
4310,Magda,B: Were nice.,184
4310,Magda,"A: but %um the hospital policy was rather unfriendly to us and they wouldn’t, like we had been told, we they have a room called the bonding room",185
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,186
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,187
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,188
4310,Magda,"A: and the whole purpose of the room is to let people be in it with the baby, who --",189
4310,Magda,B: uh-huh.,190
4310,Magda,A: -- are going to be with the baby.,191
4310,Magda,B: Right.,192
4310,Magda,"A: And they wouldn’t let us in there so,",193
4310,Magda,B: %mm.,194
4310,Magda,"A: d-, it was really quite awful.  They wouldn’t let us, they didn’t, they they gave us but they didn’t tell us beans.",195
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,196
4310,Magda,A: I mean they really didn’t talk to us. They didn’t offer us that parenting class that they offer to most people.,197
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,198
4310,Magda,A: We would have had to come back the next day to the hospital which of course we weren’t going to do.,199
4310,Magda,B: %hm.,200
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,201
4310,Magda,"A: %um, you know they really weren’t very nice and",202
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,203
4310,Magda,"A: I guess they have, their rules are just very rigid.",204
4310,Magda,B: %mm.,205
4310,Magda,A: And the problem is the lawyer was supposed to have arranged for %um,206
4310,Magda,B: Right.,207
4310,Magda,A: an additional bracelet.,208
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,209
4310,Magda,"A: In other words, what happens is they put one on the wrist of the baby, one on the ankle, one on the birth mother",210
4310,Magda,"A: and then she has a, what you call the fourth bracelet which she can give to whoever will be her coach through the birth and stuff and of course she had given it to her mother,",211
4310,Magda,B: %hm.,212
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,213
4310,Magda,B: %hm.,214
4310,Magda,B: I see.,215
4310,Magda,B: I see.,216
4310,Magda,A: which makes perfect sense.,217
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,218
4310,Magda,"A: Well, the only way, they couldn’t get their minds around the notion of a fifth bracelet for us.",219
4310,Magda,B: Right.,220
4310,Magda,"A: So the only way that they would have let us in there was to take her mothers away,",221
4310,Magda,B: Right.,222
4310,Magda,A: which we wouldn’t ask and which she wouldn’t do.,223
4310,Magda,B: Right.,224
4310,Magda,B: Right.,225
4310,Magda,A: And %um,226
4310,Magda,A: the lawyer had told us he had arranged everything ahead of time,227
4310,Magda,A: and there was supposed to be I D there at the hospital for us and it was all set and of course he hadn’t done anything.,228
4310,Magda,B: I see.,229
4310,Magda,"B: He hadn’t done that, %hm.",230
4310,Magda,A: No. He hadn’t done anything.  He’s been just hopeless.,231
4310,Magda,B: %hm.,232
4310,Magda,A: I mean I think legally he’s not hopeless.  I think he’s done all the necessary legal things but %um,233
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,234
4310,Magda,"A: you know in terms of the things,",235
4310,Magda,A: He’s an S O B forgive me tape whoever you are but he was a fucker {laugh}.,236
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,237
4310,Magda,B: No. th- {laugh},238

4310,Magda,B: I think they said published actually. {laugh},242
4310,Magda,A: oh well they can edit that word I guess {laugh} Anyway it’s English so {laugh},243
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,244

4310,Magda,B: {laugh},246
4310,Magda,A: %um,247
4310,Magda,"A: You know he, he said things to me like well you’ll have her for the rest of your life, you know.",248
4310,Magda,B: yeah.,249
4310,Magda,"A: Don’t worry about it, which is really an arrogant attitude to take, you know.",250
4310,Magda,B: yeah,251
4310,Magda,B: yeah,252
4310,Magda,B: Man. {laugh},253
4310,Magda,"A: yeah. He was really, he was a real arrogant S O B, so",254
4310,Magda,B: How old was he?,255
4310,Magda,A: I don’t know we never met him. He never showed up.,256
4310,Magda,B: oh.,257
4310,Magda,"A: W-, he ended up in the end, his par-, he sent his partner to actually sign the papers who’s not even an adoption attorney.",258
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,259
4310,Magda,A: He does litigation.  Doesn’t know what he’s doing but I hope he did what his partner told him to do.,260
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,261
4310,Magda,B: ((%mm)) [distorted],262
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,263
4310,Magda,A: But he at least was a sensitive human being.,264
4310,Magda,B: mhm.,265
4310,Magda,"A: And %um, you know so that was nice.  He had some sensitivity.",266
4310,Magda,B: We’re going to get cut off soon.,267
