"377",10,3,2,"New","to throw the anvil on the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","10-3-2-New"
"378",10,3,2,"New","so the roadrunner just like he comes up to the coyote",NA,"just, like",NA,"10-3-2-New"
"379",10,3,2,"New","and then just turns around and leaves",NA,"just",NA,"10-3-2-New"
"380",10,3,2,"New","’cause he’s so fast",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"

"394",10,3,2,"New","around the mine going in circles",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"395",10,3,2,"New","and then they get to a zigzag path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"396",10,3,2,"New","so they go through the zigzag path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"397",10,3,2,"New","and then it ends",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"398",10,3,2,"New","and it switches into two paths",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"399",10,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner takes the higher path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"400",10,3,2,"New","and the coyote takes the lower path",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"401",10,3,2,"New","and then the lower part gets really dark",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"402",10,3,2,"New","so the coyote lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"403",10,3,2,"New","to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"
"404",10,3,2,"New","and then you can see that there’s a whole bunch of TNT around him",NA,NA,NA,"10-3-2-New"

"414",11,1,1,"New","and he’s running after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"415",11,1,1,"New","and they pause roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"416",11,1,1,"New","and they actually write his name roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"417",11,1,1,"New","and they write his latin na name",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"418",11,1,1,"New","like acceleratis something",NA,"like, something",NA,"11-1-1-New"

"421",11,1,1,"New","and carnivoris vulgaris or something",NA,"or something",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"422",11,1,1,"New","and so then they continue with that",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"423",11,1,1,"New","and roadrunner starts off walking slowly",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"424",11,1,1,"New","like an airplane about to lift off",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"425",11,1,1,"New","and so it starts",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"426",11,1,1,"New","he starts running",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"427",11,1,1,"New","and it goes speed",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"428",11,1,1,"New","and becomes a blur of colors",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"429",11,1,1,"New","and coyote starts chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"430",11,1,1,"New","so then just to mock coyote uh",NA,"just",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"431",11,1,1,"New","roadrunner stops in the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"432",11,1,1,"New","and just turns around",NA,"just",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"433",11,1,1,"New","and does his you know BEEP BEEP",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"434",11,1,1,"New","and so then coyote thinks",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"435",11,1,1,"New","oh it’s my chance",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"436",11,1,1,"New","so he pounces on him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"437",11,1,1,"New","but roadrunner runs away by then",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"438",11,1,1,"New","and he falls",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"439",11,1,1,"New","coyote falls to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"440",11,1,1,"New","and his knife and his fork get stuck on the road",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"441",11,1,1,"New","so he falls down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"442",11,1,1,"New","and makes a really sad angry face",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"443",11,1,1,"New","and then he brightens up again",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"444",11,1,1,"New","’cause he has an idea",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"445",11,1,1,"New","so what he does is",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"446",11,1,1,"New","he attaches a punch that has like a spring behind it ?",NA,"like","?","11-1-1-New"
"447",11,1,1,"New","you know those punches that come out like that",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"448",11,1,1,"New","aand he attaches a string to the spring",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"449",11,1,1,"New","and ties it to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"450",11,1,1,"New","so he has it ready",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"451",11,1,1,"New","and stands behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"452",11,1,1,"New","so he when he lets go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"453",11,1,1,"New","it’s gonna bounce at coyo uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"454",11,1,1,"New","so roadrunner starts coming",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"455",11,1,1,"New","and he hears thee BEEP BEEP you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"456",11,1,1,"New","that roadru roadrunner does all the time",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"457",11,1,1,"New","and then uh he releases the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"458",11,1,1,"New","but it",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"459",11,1,1,"New","contrary to what should happen",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"460",11,1,1,"New","the rock pushes him back",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"461",11,1,1,"New","instead of the punch pushing forward",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"462",11,1,1,"New","the rock pushes back",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"463",11,1,1,"New","and crashes coyote between the mountain and the rock",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"464",11,1,1,"New","and then the punch also comes right back at him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"465",11,1,1,"New","and punches him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"466",11,1,1,"New","so then you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"467",11,1,1,"New","coyote is now really angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"468",11,1,1,"New","so he comes up with aa three step plan",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"469",11,1,1,"New","aand one is that he’s gonna get a big weight of",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"470",11,1,1,"New","a ton of weight or something?",NA,"or something","?","11-1-1-New"

"472",11,1,1,"New","to another end",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"473",11,1,1,"New","so there’s a valley down below",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"474",11,1,1,"New","and he decides he’s gonna take that ton of weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"475",11,1,1,"New","and walk across the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"476",11,1,1,"New","aand just right",NA,"just",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"477",11,1,1,"New","right when he sees the roadrunner passing by",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"478",11,1,1,"New","he’s gonna drop the ton of weight on top of roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"479",11,1,1,"New","so he picks up the weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"480",11,1,1,"New","starts walking across",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"481",11,1,1,"New","but it’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"482",11,1,1,"New","that the rope starts coming down all the way into the valley",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"483",11,1,1,"New","so he’s on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"484",11,1,1,"New","so by the time he’s on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"485",11,1,1,"New","and he’s I don’t know",NA,"I don't know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"486",11,1,1,"New","he’s about to think about what to do",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"487",11,1,1,"New","and roadrunner comes in",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"488",11,1,1,"New","mocks him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"489",11,1,1,"New","like ticks sticks his tongue out at coyote",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"490",11,1,1,"New","and then coyote gets so angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"491",11,1,1,"New","he drops the weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"492",11,1,1,"New","’cause I guess he’s gonna run after him or hit him",NA,"I guess",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"493",11,1,1,"New","but because he drops the weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"494",11,1,1,"New","he gets pushed bounced all the way up by the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"495",11,1,1,"New","so he’s like flying in the air",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"496",11,1,1,"New","and then he pats his back",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"497",11,1,1,"New","because he has a bag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"498",11,1,1,"New","so he’s like oh I got a parachute",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"499",11,1,1,"New","he doesn’t say anything obviously",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"500",11,1,1,"New","but you know that’s what we think",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"501",11,1,1,"New","so he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"502",11,1,1,"New","the bag opens",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"503",11,1,1,"New","but all of these things come out of the bag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"504",11,1,1,"New","like bowls and hats or something",NA,"like, or something",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"505",11,1,1,"New","but it’s no there’s no parachute there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"506",11,1,1,"New","so then he’s like ah that’s it",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"507",11,1,1,"New","so he takes out a box of uh aspirin ?",NA,NA,"?","11-1-1-New"
"508",11,1,1,"New","takes them",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"509",11,1,1,"New","and then says goodbye",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"510",11,1,1,"New","and falls down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"511",11,1,1,"New","then somehow as usual in the cartoons",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"512",11,1,1,"New","he’s alive again",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"513",11,1,1,"New","and um he comes up",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"514",11,1,1,"New","he starts chasing uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"515",11,1,1,"New","aand they go into this uh cave",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"516",11,1,1,"New","which is called a pine cave pine mine or something uh",NA,"or something",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"517",11,1,1,"New","cactus mine",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"518",11,1,1,"New","aand they start running",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"519",11,1,1,"New","bec but but he",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"520",11,1,1,"New","as he’s running",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"521",11,1,1,"New","coyote’s chasing after uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"522",11,1,1,"New","after a little while it becomes really dark in there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"523",11,1,1,"New","so he turns back around",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"524",11,1,1,"New","gets those construction hats",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"525",11,1,1,"New","with the lights on top",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"526",11,1,1,"New","aand while he’s putting that on",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"527",11,1,1,"New","roadrunner comes back up behind him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"528",11,1,1,"New","and says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"529",11,1,1,"New","because he’s already had his hat on",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"530",11,1,1,"New","so coyote’s still like engulfed in just trying to catch roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"531",11,1,1,"New","that he doesn’t even know what’s going on",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"532",11,1,1,"New","so he starts running after him with the cap",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"533",11,1,1,"New","and it’s like a maze of tunnels",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"534",11,1,1,"New","so it’s like a square first",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"535",11,1,1,"New","and they keep going around and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"536",11,1,1,"New","and then coyote goes off to the left",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"537",11,1,1,"New","and waits",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"538",11,1,1,"New","and coyo uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"539",11,1,1,"New","roadrunner goes off to the left",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"540",11,1,1,"New","you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"541",11,1,1,"New","another tunnel like this",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"542",11,1,1,"New","waits there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"543",11,1,1,"New","while coyote keeps going around and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"544",11,1,1,"New","and then roadrunner BEEP BEEPed",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"545",11,1,1,"New","and says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"546",11,1,1,"New","and then coyote’s like oh he’s over there",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"547",11,1,1,"New","so he starts running after him again",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"548",11,1,1,"New","and then they get to this tunn uh elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"549",11,1,1,"New","okay so roadrunner goes into the elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"550",11,1,1,"New","it’s like an open elevator",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"551",11,1,1,"New","it’s one of those bases with strings attached",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"552",11,1,1,"New","like a pulley kind of",NA,"like, kind of",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"553",11,1,1,"New","so roadrunner steps onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"554",11,1,1,"New","and so he goes down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"555",11,1,1,"New","so coyote is like you know I have to go chase after him",NA,"like, youknow",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"556",11,1,1,"New","so he sees another uh elevator kind of thing",NA,"kind of, thing",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"557",11,1,1,"New","so coyote goes into that one",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"558",11,1,1,"New","but then what happens is because he goes into that one",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"559",11,1,1,"New","he goes up and uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"560",11,1,1,"New","he goes down and roadrunner comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"561",11,1,1,"New","because it’s they’re attached","right",NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"562",11,1,1,"New","you know the pulley system",NA,"you know",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"563",11,1,1,"New","so they get off",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"564",11,1,1,"New","roadrunner get gets off the elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"565",11,1,1,"New","and then coyote follows him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"566",11,1,1,"New","and they go into another tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"567",11,1,1,"New","so it’s like the mine",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"568",11,1,1,"New","but they make it a flat map",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"569",11,1,1,"New","okay ?",NA,NA,"?","11-1-1-New"
"570",11,1,1,"New","where there’s a square tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"571",11,1,1,"New","so they get to the tunnel that’s a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"572",11,1,1,"New","it goes up and down up and down up and down",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"573",11,1,1,"New","so coyo roadrunner starts going in that tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"574",11,1,1,"New","so coyote chases after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"575",11,1,1,"New","then the uh zigzag ends at this place",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"576",11,1,1,"New","where there’s like fork",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"577",11,1,1,"New","okay a Y",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"578",11,1,1,"New","one branch goes up there",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"579",11,1,1,"New","and one keeps going straight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"580",11,1,1,"New","so roadrunner quickly goes to that branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"581",11,1,1,"New","while coyote keeps going straight",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"582",11,1,1,"New","and there’s none",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"583",11,1,1,"New","before they were in the zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"584",11,1,1,"New","like up and down up and down",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"585",11,1,1,"New","and now it’s just a straight flat thing",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"586",11,1,1,"New","but coyote keeps going up and down as if it’s aa zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"587",11,1,1,"New","so he keeps bumping up on the ceiling",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"588",11,1,1,"New","then against the wall",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"589",11,1,1,"New","then the ceiling then against the wall",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"590",11,1,1,"New","until his light bursts",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"591",11,1,1,"New","and so then he’s like you have to do something",NA,"like",NA,"11-1-1-New"
"592",11,1,1,"New","you can’t see anything",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"593",11,1,1,"New","and so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"594",11,1,1,"New","and right next to him",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"595",11,1,1,"New","there’s a  huge room filled with TNT boxes",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"596",11,1,1,"New","so then it explodes",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"597",11,1,1,"New","and it says YIPES",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"598",11,1,1,"New","that’s basically it",NA,NA,NA,"11-1-1-New"
"599",11,2,1,"Old","okay so",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"600",11,2,1,"Old","this is the cartoon of roadrunner and coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"601",11,2,1,"Old","aand you know it’s that famous cartoon",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"602",11,2,1,"Old","that comes with bugs bunny",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"603",11,2,1,"Old","and so what happens is",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"604",11,2,1,"Old","they start off showing",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"605",11,2,1,"Old","coyote chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"606",11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner is running and running",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"607",11,2,1,"Old","so they pause him in the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"608",11,2,1,"Old","just to introduce him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"609",11,2,1,"Old","like as a main character",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"610",11,2,1,"Old","and so they write roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"611",11,2,1,"Old","and they write a latin name for him too",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"612",11,2,1,"Old","like accelerat-tis something",NA,"like, something",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"613",11,2,1,"Old","or it’s not true latin",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"614",11,2,1,"Old","it’s just a play on words",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"615",11,2,1,"Old","and then sthey they then go",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"616",11,2,1,"Old","and then they focus on coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"617",11,2,1,"Old","and they pause on him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"618",11,2,1,"Old","and they say",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"626",11,2,1,"Old","eat up the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"627",11,2,1,"Old","so roadrunner’s",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"628",11,2,1,"Old","they sh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"629",11,2,1,"Old","then they go back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"680",11,2,1,"Old","so coyote at that moment releases the punch",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"681",11,2,1,"Old","but instead of the punch going forward",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"682",11,2,1,"Old","like hitting uh roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"683",11,2,1,"Old","the rock gets pushed back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"684",11,2,1,"Old","and smashes uh coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"685",11,2,1,"Old","between the rock itself from the mountain",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"687",11,2,1,"Old","not only does the rock go back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"688",11,2,1,"Old","but the punch turns around and punches coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"689",11,2,1,"Old","so he gets hit twice",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"690",11,2,1,"Old","so then he’s like okay",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"691",11,2,1,"Old","then he comes up with a three step plan",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"698",11,2,1,"Old","where he knows that roadrunner’s gonna run through",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"699",11,2,1,"Old","and he brings this big ton of weight",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"700",11,2,1,"Old","that he’s gonna cr carry across the rope",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"701",11,2,1,"Old","and wait at the center",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"702",11,2,1,"Old","and then coyo uh roadrunner passes by",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"703",11,2,1,"Old","he’s gonna drop the weight on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"704",11,2,1,"Old","and smash him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"705",11,2,1,"Old","and get rid of him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"709",11,2,1,"Old","that the whole rope starts bending down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"710",11,2,1,"Old","so it’s attached to the mountain",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"711",11,2,1,"Old","but in the center he’s bending down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"712",11,2,1,"Old","so he f stands",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"713",11,2,1,"Old","he’s basically standing on the rope",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"714",11,2,1,"Old","so roadrunner comes up to him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"715",11,2,1,"Old","and says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"716",11,2,1,"Old","sticks his tongue out at him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"717",11,2,1,"Old","and mocks him you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"718",11,2,1,"Old","like you’re gonna do what I thought here",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"719",11,2,1,"Old","so coyote then gets really upset",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"724",11,2,1,"Old","you know the weight push",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"725",11,2,1,"Old","the tightrope pushes him back up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"726",11,2,1,"Old","and as he’s going",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"746",11,2,1,"Old","and then he goes uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"747",11,2,1,"Old","starts chasing roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"748",11,2,1,"Old","aand roadrunner runs into a cactus mine",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"749",11,2,1,"Old","like a mine you know",NA,"like, you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"750",11,2,1,"Old","a cave and tunnels",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"751",11,2,1,"Old","so coyote starts chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"752",11,2,1,"Old","and after a few you know feet",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"753",11,2,1,"Old","they get he coyote hits darkness",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"754",11,2,1,"Old","there’s no light",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"757",11,2,1,"Old","a construction hat that has a light on him on it",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"758",11,2,1,"Old","aand uh roadrunner comes up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"759",11,2,1,"Old","right behind",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"760",11,2,1,"Old","he has already taken the hat",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"761",11,2,1,"Old","he’s all ready",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"762",11,2,1,"Old","so he says BEEP BEEP again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"764",11,2,1,"Old","so he puts on the hat",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"765",11,2,1,"Old","starts chasing coyo uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"766",11,2,1,"Old","so then roadrunner ends up going you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"767",11,2,1,"Old","round and round in one square",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"768",11,2,1,"Old","they make",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"769",11,2,1,"Old","instead of showing the cave",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"770",11,2,1,"Old","they show a flat map of the cave",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"771",11,2,1,"Old","and they make green and red dots",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"772",11,2,1,"Old","for red dot is for coyote and green dot is for roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"773",11,2,1,"Old","aand so what happens is uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"774",11,2,1,"Old","coyote starts chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"775",11,2,1,"Old","so first roadrunner follows a basic square pattern",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"776",11,2,1,"Old","he keeps going s in the square",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"777",11,2,1,"Old","like from here to here to here to here",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"778",11,2,1,"Old","and after a while",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"779",11,2,1,"Old","coyote thinks he just continues to go like that",NA,"just",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"780",11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner steps off to the side",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"781",11,2,1,"Old","and just coyote keeps going like that",NA,"just",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"782",11,2,1,"Old","even though roadrunner is already on the other side",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"783",11,2,1,"Old","so then roadrunner says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"784",11,2,1,"Old","and coyote turns back around",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"785",11,2,1,"Old","and sees him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"786",11,2,1,"Old","and so chases him again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"787",11,2,1,"Old","and this time",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"788",11,2,1,"Old","uh they flip it back to the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"789",11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner steps onto an elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"790",11,2,1,"Old","you know like a flat platform with a chain attached to the top",NA,"you know, like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"791",11,2,1,"Old","aand he goes down",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"792",11,2,1,"Old","and so then coyote sees that there’s another elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"793",11,2,1,"Old","right next to it",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"794",11,2,1,"Old","so he steps into that",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"795",11,2,1,"Old","and when he goes down the elevator comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"796",11,2,1,"Old","the roadrunner comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"797",11,2,1,"Old","so then after a while he comes back",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"798",11,2,1,"Old","and he starts chasing him again",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"799",11,2,1,"Old","and roadrunner runs into a tunnel that’s zig",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"800",11,2,1,"Old","it’s going up and down like a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"801",11,2,1,"Old","if you look at it in a flat way",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"802",11,2,1,"Old","aand so it keeps going",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"803",11,2,1,"Old","and coyote starts chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"804",11,2,1,"Old","keeps going keeps going",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"805",11,2,1,"Old","so then at the end of the zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"806",11,2,1,"Old","there’s a fork or a Y",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"807",11,2,1,"Old","one f side goes up",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"808",11,2,1,"Old","and one keeps going straight",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"809",11,2,1,"Old","without a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"810",11,2,1,"Old","like a flat area",NA,"like",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"811",11,2,1,"Old","so roadrunner goes up to the top branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"812",11,2,1,"Old","and uh it’s coyote goes to the bottom branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"813",11,2,1,"Old","but he doesn’t notice that",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"814",11,2,1,"Old","it’s not going up and down anymore",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"817",11,2,1,"Old","until you know his hat",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"818",11,2,1,"Old","so he keeps bumping up into the ceiling",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"819",11,2,1,"Old","and then down onto the floor",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"820",11,2,1,"Old","and the light on his cap just bursts",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"821",11,2,1,"Old","and you know it goes out",NA,"you know",NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"823",11,2,1,"Old","he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"
"824",11,2,1,"Old","and all around him you see boxes of TNT",NA,NA,NA,"11-2-1-Old"

"956",11,3,2,"New","he runs runs into it after the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"957",11,3,2,"New","and after a little while it gets really dark",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"958",11,3,2,"New","‘cause there’s no light in there",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"959",11,3,2,"New","so he turns back around",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"960",11,3,2,"New","goes back",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"961",11,3,2,"New","and at the entrance of the cave there’s",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"

"976",11,3,2,"New","so then um roadrunner runs away",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"977",11,3,2,"New","and coyote gets angry again",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"978",11,3,2,"New","so he starts chasing him",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"979",11,3,2,"New","and he starts chasing",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"980",11,3,2,"New","and then what happens is in the cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"981",11,3,2,"New","they show you a flat like map kind of everything",NA,"like, kind of",NA,"11-3-2-New"
"982",11,3,2,"New","where they show you the tunnels",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"983",11,3,2,"New","how they are","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"984",11,3,2,"New","so this is a square tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"985",11,3,2,"New","it’s a square shape",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"986",11,3,2,"New","and coyote has a red light you know",NA,"you know",NA,"11-3-2-New"
"987",11,3,2,"New","represented by a red light",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"988",11,3,2,"New","and roadrunner’s represented by a green light",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"989",11,3,2,"New","and so what happens is uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"990",11,3,2,"New","coyote starts chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"991",11,3,2,"New","and roadrunner starts running around the track",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"992",11,3,2,"New","keeps running and running",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"993",11,3,2,"New","so coyote keeps running",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"994",11,3,2,"New","and then roadrunner just steps off to the side",NA,"just",NA,"11-3-2-New"
"995",11,3,2,"New","in another branch of the tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"996",11,3,2,"New","aand",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"997",11,3,2,"New","but coyote keeps going around and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"998",11,3,2,"New","and then c uh",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"999",11,3,2,"New","roadrunner just says BEEP BEEP again",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1000",11,3,2,"New","and then coyote comes back",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1001",11,3,2,"New","and starts chasing him again in the right direction",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1002",11,3,2,"New","so they keep going and going",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1003",11,3,2,"New","until roadrunner comes onto an elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1004",11,3,2,"New","it’s not really an elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1005",11,3,2,"New","it’s like a flat platform ?",NA,"like","?","11-3-2-New"
"1006",11,3,2,"New","that has strings attached to it",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1007",11,3,2,"New","like pulleys ?",NA,"like","?","11-3-2-New"
"1008",11,3,2,"New","goes up and down ?",NA,NA,"?","11-3-2-New"
"1009",11,3,2,"New","so roadrunner comes onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1010",11,3,2,"New","says BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1011",11,3,2,"New","and goes down",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1012",11,3,2,"New","so then coyote looks around",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1013",11,3,2,"New","and right next to it conveniently is placed another elevator",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1014",11,3,2,"New","of the same style",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1015",11,3,2,"New","so coyote jumps onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1016",11,3,2,"New","but because he jumps onto that",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1017",11,3,2,"New","he goes down and the other thing comes back up",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1018",11,3,2,"New","so then he gets really angry",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1019",11,3,2,"New","and somehow they meet up again","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1020",11,3,2,"New","and roadrunner starts running into this tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1021",11,3,2,"New","that’s going zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1022",11,3,2,"New","again they show you a flat map",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1023",11,3,2,"New","you know going zigzag","yeah","you know",NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1024",11,3,2,"New","so I guess it’s like up and down you know …",NA,"I guess, like, you know",NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1025",11,3,2,"New","and so coyote keeps chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1026",11,3,2,"New","until they get to the end",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1027",11,3,2,"New","and it forks off",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1028",11,3,2,"New","one branch goes up diagonally",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1029",11,3,2,"New","and one keeps going down this way",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1030",11,3,2,"New","but both of them become flat",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1031",11,3,2,"New","they’re not zigzags anymore","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1032",11,3,2,"New","so roadrunner goes up to the top branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1033",11,3,2,"New","and coyote keeps going to this other branch",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1034",11,3,2,"New","and while there",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1035",11,3,2,"New","he doesn’t notice that not going zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1036",11,3,2,"New","or that he’s doing that motion of zigzagging",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"
"1037",11,3,2,"New","and he keeps going up and down even in a flat tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"11-3-2-New"

"1233",13,1,1,"New","he’s gonna drop an anvil on him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1234",13,1,1,"New","so he walks out on the string with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1235",13,1,1,"New","and the thing just bellies",NA,NA,"just","13-1-1-New"
"1236",13,1,1,"New","and he’s like touching the ground",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1237",13,1,1,"New","so the roadrunner comes up next to him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1238",13,1,1,"New","makes his noise",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1239",13,1,1,"New","the coyote throws th the anvil on the side",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1240",13,1,1,"New","’cause the roadrunner takes off",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1241",13,1,1,"New","’cause he is gonna go chase him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1242",13,1,1,"New","so when he throws the anvil on his side",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1243",13,1,1,"New","the thing shoots him up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"

"1249",13,1,1,"New","it’s not a parachute like pots and pans come flying out of it",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1250",13,1,1,"New","and um then he has a thing of aspirin",NA,NA,"a thing","13-1-1-New"
"1251",13,1,1,"New","and he was like pops that in his mouth",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1252",13,1,1,"New","’cause he hits the ground and smashes",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1253",13,1,1,"New","and then his last plan",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1254",13,1,1,"New","well it wasn’t really a plan",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1255",13,1,1,"New","he um saw the ah roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1256",13,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner was going towards like a a coal mine ?",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1257",13,1,1,"New","coyote chases him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1258",13,1,1,"New","and um as he gets halfway in he realizes he can’t see anymore",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1259",13,1,1,"New","so he has to go back and get a a hat with a helmet on",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1260",13,1,1,"New","when he does that the roadrunner is right there",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"

"1263",13,1,1,"New","and um the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1264",13,1,1,"New","all you could see was uh was kinda like a little grid",NA,NA,"kinda, like","13-1-1-New"
"1265",13,1,1,"New","it was like a path that went up and it went like that",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1266",13,1,1,"New","but then there was like parts to the side",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1267",13,1,1,"New","and uh roadrunner was like a green dot and coyote was the red",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1268",13,1,1,"New","so coyote is chasing him in the mine",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1269",13,1,1,"New","and then like it just gets really fast",NA,NA,"like, just","13-1-1-New"
"1270",13,1,1,"New","they keep going in like this little square",NA,NA,"like, just","13-1-1-New"
"1271",13,1,1,"New","and then the roadrunner like started going up",NA,NA,"like, just","13-1-1-New"
"1272",13,1,1,"New","but then he went into the side",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"

"1274",13,1,1,"New","but he is not",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1275",13,1,1,"New","roadrunner makes his noise coyote sees it and goes and follows him",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1276",13,1,1,"New","and then somehow they wind up in like this little zigzag pattern",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1277",13,1,1,"New","and um at the end of it there was uh like a tunnel going up",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1278",13,1,1,"New","and one going straight",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1279",13,1,1,"New","roadrunner goes up coyote goes down",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"

"1281",13,1,1,"New","as the coyote is going down",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1282",13,1,1,"New","he’s like bumping his head on this on the top and bottom of it the path",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1283",13,1,1,"New","and um breaks his light",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"

"1286",13,1,1,"New","and all behind him you can see TNT",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1287",13,1,1,"New","so the match makes it blow up",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"
"1288",13,1,1,"New","and then it just shows the top part of like the um the desert",NA,NA,"like","13-1-1-New"
"1289",13,1,1,"New","there’s cactuses",NA,NA,NA,"13-1-1-New"

"1295",13,2,2,"New","and then you see like two like figures like running really fast ?",NA,"like, like","?","13-2-2-New"
"1296",13,2,2,"New","and then it it pauses",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1297",13,2,2,"New","and you see the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1298",13,2,2,"New","aand like underneath the roadrunner uh",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1299",13,2,2,"New","in parentheses it says uh incredible speed",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1300",13,2,2,"New","and then it flashes the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"

"1304",13,2,2,"New","like the roadrunner is going like just fast enough",NA,"like, like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1305",13,2,2,"New","so that the the coyote can keep up with him",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1306",13,2,2,"New","then they like pause for a minute",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1307",13,2,2,"New","and the coyote tries to dig the knife and fork into him",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1308",13,2,2,"New","and then the c roadrunner just takes off",NA,"just",NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1309",13,2,2,"New","so he the road uh",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1310",13,2,2,"New","coyote is left with his fork and knife in the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1311",13,2,2,"New","and he falls face first in the ground",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1312",13,2,2,"New","so he comes up with this plan that um",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1313",13,2,2,"New","that he has a a boxing glove with a spring in it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"

"1315",13,2,2,"New","so that way he’s gonna push the glove in",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1316",13,2,2,"New","and then he has a string",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1317",13,2,2,"New","and that way when he saw the coyote or the roadrunner he would pull it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1318",13,2,2,"New","and the boxing glove would like shoot out at the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1319",13,2,2,"New","and maybe like knock him out ?",NA,"maybe, like","?","13-2-2-New"
"1320",13,2,2,"New","well when he hears the uh roadrunner coming",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1321",13,2,2,"New","he has already has a string in his hand",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1322",13,2,2,"New","and when he goes to pull it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1323",13,2,2,"New","the bo",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1324",13,2,2,"New","the rock moves back and pushes him up against the uh the mountain",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1325",13,2,2,"New","and he gets like hit",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1326",13,2,2,"New","and the road the roadrunner’s fine",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1327",13,2,2,"New","and then you see when they show the coyote again",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1328",13,2,2,"New","the boxing glove with the spring come back",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1329",13,2,2,"New","and hits him in the face again",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1330",13,2,2,"New","so his next plan he uh he’s on the two like cliffs",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1331",13,2,2,"New","and then there’s the road underneath",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"

"1334",13,2,2,"New","and he is gonna walk out in the middle of it",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1335",13,2,2,"New","and the plan was for the anvil to drop on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1336",13,2,2,"New","when he came through",NA,NA,NA,"13-2-2-New"
"1337",13,2,2,"New","but when he walked out on the um the rope it like bellied",NA,"like",NA,"13-2-2-New"

"1425",13,3,1,"Old","he was gonna stand behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1426",13,3,1,"Old","so it would shoot out the the glove at the uh roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1427",13,3,1,"Old","it might knock him out",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"

"1429",13,3,1,"Old","he has a sting in his hand he pulls it",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1430",13,3,1,"Old","instead of the glove moving",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1431",13,3,1,"Old","the rock moves",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1432",13,3,1,"Old","and it like crushed him up against the side of the mountain",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"

"1435",13,3,1,"Old","so then his next plan is um",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1436",13,3,1,"Old","he has there is the two uh cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1437",13,3,1,"Old","and then underneath is the road",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"

"1441",13,3,1,"Old","he’s gonna walk out into the middle",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1442",13,3,1,"Old","and wait for the roadrunner to come drop it on him",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"

"1447",13,3,1,"Old","makes his noise",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1448",13,3,1,"Old","coyote gets mad",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1449",13,3,1,"Old","and he like throws the anvil to the side",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1450",13,3,1,"Old","so that way he would chase the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1451",13,3,1,"Old","but when he does that",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1452",13,3,1,"Old","it flings him up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"

"1462",13,3,1,"Old","then he smashes in the ground when he gets down there",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1463",13,3,1,"Old","so then the next time he sees the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1464",13,3,1,"Old","the roadrunner like leads him into the coal mine",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"

"1479",13,3,1,"Old","trying to pretend like he’s following the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1480",13,3,1,"Old","and um then the roadrunner makes a noise",NA,NA,NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1481",13,3,1,"Old","and you see the coyote like come back",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"
"1482",13,3,1,"Old","and go to like the thing that the roadrunner is on",NA,"like",NA,"13-3-1-Old"

"2118",15,3,2,"New","so he blows himself up",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"
"2119",15,3,2,"New","and then like the end is just like",NA,"like, just, like",NA,"15-3-2-New"
"2120",15,3,2,"New","there’s a word that says YIPE",NA,NA,NA,"15-3-2-New"

"2125",16,1,1,"New","I don’t know if you’ve ever seen that",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2126",16,1,1,"New","and um the cartoon starts off where",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2127",16,1,1,"New","the coyote is chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2128",16,1,1,"New","but the roadrunner is going too fast",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2129",16,1,1,"New","so like he can’t catch up to it ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
"2130",16,1,1,"New","and the coyote has um",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2131",16,1,1,"New","he’s holding like a knife and a fork",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2132",16,1,1,"New","and he’s like trying to eat the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2133",16,1,1,"New","they’re running",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2134",16,1,1,"New","aand he can’t catch up to it",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2135",16,1,1,"New","so then he comes up with these like plans",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2136",16,1,1,"New","in order to catch the roadrunner?",NA,NA,"?","16-1-1-New"
"2137",16,1,1,"New","so the first plan",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2138",16,1,1,"New","he had um like a boxing glove connected to",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2139",16,1,1,"New","a spring",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2140",16,1,1,"New","and he tied it to a rock",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2141",16,1,1,"New","so that way he would like pull the spring back",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2142",16,1,1,"New","and then like when the roadrunner runs by",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2143",16,1,1,"New","he would let go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2144",16,1,1,"New","and then like the boxing glove would hit it ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
"2145",16,1,1,"New","and kill it I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2146",16,1,1,"New","but instead of really doing that",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2147",16,1,1,"New","thee uh the rock backfires",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2148",16,1,1,"New","and like hits him",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2149",16,1,1,"New","so like he doesn’t get it",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2150",16,1,1,"New","and then he decides to put a string",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2151",16,1,1,"New","connected from one mountain into another ?",NA,NA,"?","16-1-1-New"
"2152",16,1,1,"New","and he would carry like a big anvil",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2153",16,1,1,"New","and like walk into the middle of the string",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2154",16,1,1,"New","and then when the roadrunner like ran down",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2155",16,1,1,"New","it would uh drop the anvil on it",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2156",16,1,1,"New","but when he walks onto thee the s",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2157",16,1,1,"New","the e rope that he has",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2158",16,1,1,"New","instead of it like staying up there it comes all the way down",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2159",16,1,1,"New","so now he’s like on the floor with the anvil in his hand",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2160",16,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner like runs up to him",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2161",16,1,1,"New","and he drops the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2162",16,1,1,"New","and he like ricochets up into the air",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2163",16,1,1,"New","because of like the uh","mm-hmm","like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2164",16,1,1,"New","the string was like pulled down","yeah","like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2165",16,1,1,"New","and he had this uh parachute ?",NA,NA,"?","16-1-1-New"
"2166",16,1,1,"New","on his back",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2167",16,1,1,"New","but when he pulled the string of the parachute",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2168",16,1,1,"New","all these like little items fall out",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2169",16,1,1,"New","so there’s no parachute",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2170",16,1,1,"New","so he ends up like falling to the ground",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2171",16,1,1,"New","aand then the roadrunner like runs into some cave",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2172",16,1,1,"New","or something",NA,"or something",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2173",16,1,1,"New","so he’s following him into the cave",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2174",16,1,1,"New","and like running around the cave or whatever",NA,"like, or whatever",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2175",16,1,1,"New","and he can’t catch up to him",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2176",16,1,1,"New","and he keeps like being outsmarted by the roadrunner ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
"2177",16,1,1,"New","and then so they’re like running all around for a while",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2178",16,1,1,"New","aand then he finds himself like",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2179",16,1,1,"New","it’s like really dark in the cave",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2180",16,1,1,"New","so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2181",16,1,1,"New","and there’s all like TNT and dynamite behind him ?",NA,"like","?","16-1-1-New"
"2182",16,1,1,"New","so then like he blows up",NA,"like",NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2183",16,1,1,"New","and that’s the end basically",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2184",16,1,1,"New","so he never catches the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"16-1-1-New"
"2185",16,2,2,"New","um okay it was a roadrunner and wile e. coyote uh","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
"2186",16,2,2,"New","cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"

"2192",16,2,2,"New","and eat it",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
"2193",16,2,2,"New","but the c the roadrunner is too fast",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
"2194",16,2,2,"New","so he never catches up to him",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"
"2195",16,2,2,"New","so he thinks of plaans in order to catch the roadrunner ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","16-2-2-New"
"2196",16,2,2,"New","so his first plan was",NA,NA,NA,"16-2-2-New"

"3186",2,2,2,"New","do you know that one ?","yeah","like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3187",2,2,2,"New","okay so the coyote is like chasing he roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3188",2,2,2,"New","and he wants to eat him",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3189",2,2,2,"New","’cause like he has a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3190",2,2,2,"New","and he doesn’t get the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3191",2,2,2,"New","and he gets really frustrated",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3192",2,2,2,"New","and he like thinks up a plot to get him",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3193",2,2,2,"New","and the first plot that he thinks of is that",NA,"like, like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3194",2,2,2,"New","he rigs like a a punching no like a fist",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3195",2,2,2,"New","like a punching glove",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3196",2,2,2,"New","so that it will like spring out of a boulder",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3197",2,2,2,"New","as the roadrunner is going by",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3198",2,2,2,"New","and I guesslike punch him ?",NA,"I guess, like","?","2-2-2-New"
"3199",2,2,2,"New","but something goes wrong and",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3200",2,2,2,"New","the coyote ends up getting smooshed by the boulder",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3201",2,2,2,"New","and gets punched in the face by like his own contraption ?",NA,"like","?","2-2-2-New"
"3202",2,2,2,"New","so that doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3203",2,2,2,"New","so then he decides that that he’s",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3204",2,2,2,"New","he’s going to take a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3205",2,2,2,"New","and like fix it between two cliffs",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3206",2,2,2,"New","so there’s a tightrope connecting two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3207",2,2,2,"New","and he’s going to take an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3208",2,2,2,"New","like a really like heavy block ?",NA,"like, like","?","2-2-2-New"
"3209",2,2,2,"New","and he’s gonna walk out on it",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3210",2,2,2,"New","and because of the weight",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3211",2,2,2,"New","the tightrope is going to dip down to the middle of the ground below",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3212",2,2,2,"New","where the roadrunner would be running ?",NA,NA,"?","2-2-2-New"
"3213",2,2,2,"New","so I guess he figures that the roadrunner is gonna step on the tightrope",NA,"I guess",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3214",2,2,2,"New","and it will spring back up and like fling him in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3215",2,2,2,"New","but it doesn’t work out obviously",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3216",2,2,2,"New","so what happens is like the coyote ends up getting flung in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3217",2,2,2,"New","and while he’s like up in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3218",2,2,2,"New","he doesn’t like have a parachute in his little backpack",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3219",2,2,2,"New","so he like falls to the ground",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3220",2,2,2,"New","and I don’t know I guess he doesn’t die",NA,"I don't know, I guess",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3221",2,2,2,"New","but so then they are in like a mine field ?",NA,"like","?","2-2-2-New"
"3222",2,2,2,"New","like you know with mining hats and everything",NA,"like, you know",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3223",2,2,2,"New","and the coyote is chasing the roadrunner around in the dark ?",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3224",2,2,2,"New","and they have like little lights on their hats ?",NA,"like","?","2-2-2-New"
"3225",2,2,2,"New","so all you see is the different color lights",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3226",2,2,2,"New","chasing each other in the different tunnels ?",NA,NA,"?","2-2-2-New"
"3227",2,2,2,"New","and it ends with the coyote like lighting a match",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3228",2,2,2,"New","and he’s surrounded by dynamite ?",NA,NA,"?","2-2-2-New"
"3229",2,2,2,"New","and he doesn’t know that",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3230",2,2,2,"New","but he ends up exploding like the whole mine field",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3231",2,2,2,"New","and it says like YIKES up on top",NA,"like",NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3232",2,2,2,"New","and that’s the end",NA,NA,NA,"2-2-2-New"
"3233",2,3,1,"Old","so the cartoon involves the roadrunner and the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3234",2,3,1,"Old","and the coyote is always trying to get the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3235",2,3,1,"Old","but the roadrunner’s too fast",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3236",2,3,1,"Old","so in the first scene it’s the coyote chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3237",2,3,1,"Old","and he wants to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3238",2,3,1,"Old","he has like a knife and a fork",NA,"like",NA,"2-3-1-Old"

"3240",2,3,1,"Old","but the roadrunner outruns him",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3241",2,3,1,"Old","so he ends up getting really frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3242",2,3,1,"Old","and he like devises these different like plots",NA,"like, like",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3243",2,3,1,"Old","for how he’s gonna trap the roadrunner ?",NA,NA,"?","2-3-1-Old"
"3244",2,3,1,"Old","and the first one he comes up with is that",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3245",2,3,1,"Old","he somehow attaches like a boxing glove on a spring to a boulder ?",NA,"like","?","2-3-1-Old"
"3246",2,3,1,"Old","and he rigs it up",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3247",2,3,1,"Old","so that when the roadrunner runs past he’ll release the boxing glove",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3248",2,3,1,"Old","and the spring will like punch him the roadrunner ?",NA,"like","?","2-3-1-Old"
"3249",2,3,1,"Old","but it doesn’t end it doesn’t work and whatever and ends up that",NA,"and whatever",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3250",2,3,1,"Old","the coyote gets smooshed by the boulder",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3251",2,3,1,"Old","and he gets punched in the face",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3252",2,3,1,"Old","so the roadrunner gets away",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3253",2,3,1,"Old","so his second plot is that",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3254",2,3,1,"Old","he devises a tightrope ? between two cliffs",NA,NA,"?","2-3-1-Old"
"3255",2,3,1,"Old","and he takes an anvil",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3256",2,3,1,"Old","and he walks out on the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3257",2,3,1,"Old","so that the weight of the anvil will like lower the tightrope ?",NA,"like","?","2-3-1-Old"
"3258",2,3,1,"Old","so that when the roadrunner steps on it",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3259",2,3,1,"Old","when he’s on the road below",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3260",2,3,1,"Old","then he’ll like fling up in the air",NA,"like",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3261",2,3,1,"Old","but it doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3262",2,3,1,"Old","and the coyote gets thrown up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3263",2,3,1,"Old","and there’s no parachute in his little backpack ? to save him ?",NA,NA,"?, ?","2-3-1-Old"
"3264",2,3,1,"Old","so he like falls to the ground and I guess he dies or whatever",NA,"like, I guess, or whatever",NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3265",2,3,1,"Old","and then it switches to them chasing each other in like a mine field ?",NA,"like, I guess, or whatever","?","2-3-1-Old"
"3266",2,3,1,"Old","but it’s underground ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","2-3-1-Old"
"3267",2,3,1,"Old","okay",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"
"3268",2,3,1,"Old","so they’re wearing their little hats with the lights on it",NA,NA,NA,"2-3-1-Old"

"3448",21,1,1,"New","he takes like a burst of acceleration",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3449",21,1,1,"New","so he sstabs the ground",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3450",21,1,1,"New","and then he’s like stuck in the ground with his fork and his knife",NA,"like",NA,"21-1-1-New"

"3462",21,1,1,"New","and I guess he’s gonna let it go",NA,"I guess",NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3463",21,1,1,"New","so it punches the roadrunner when he runs by",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3464",21,1,1,"New","so the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3465",21,1,1,"New","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3466",21,1,1,"New","and the fist stays in place",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3467",21,1,1,"New","and the rock goes back",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3468",21,1,1,"New","and pushes him into a rock",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3469",21,1,1,"New","and then the fist comes back",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3470",21,1,1,"New","and punches him in the head",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3471",21,1,1,"New","so now he’s got another idea",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3472",21,1,1,"New","so he gets a blueprint",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3473",21,1,1,"New","and it’s um a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3474",21,1,1,"New","and him carrying an anvil out standing on the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3475",21,1,1,"New","and dropping the anvil on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3476",21,1,1,"New","when he runs by",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3477",21,1,1,"New","it’s between two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3478",21,1,1,"New","so it says um plaan you know",NA,"you know",NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3479",21,1,1,"New","walk out on tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3480",21,1,1,"New","number two drop anvil on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3481",21,1,1,"New","number three roadrunner burger or something like that",NA,"or something like that",NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3482",21,1,1,"New","um so he drops his blueprint",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3483",21,1,1,"New","and he goes out with his um anvil",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3484",21,1,1,"New","but the anvil is too heavy",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3485",21,1,1,"New","and it weighs him down the line",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3486",21,1,1,"New","so he ends up down on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3487",21,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3488",21,1,1,"New","and he’s just holding it",NA,"just",NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3489",21,1,1,"New","the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3490",21,1,1,"New","and he turns around he goes back",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3491",21,1,1,"New","so he gets mad",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3492",21,1,1,"New","he just throws the anvil",NA,"just",NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3493",21,1,1,"New","but now the line isn’t heavy anymore",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3494",21,1,1,"New","so he goes flying up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3495",21,1,1,"New","and he’s got on a green backpack",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3496",21,1,1,"New","and he pulls a string",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3497",21,1,1,"New","but all kinds of junk starts coming out",NA,"kinds of junk",NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3498",21,1,1,"New","and no parachute",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3499",21,1,1,"New","so then um he grabs aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3500",21,1,1,"New","out of his pack",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3501",21,1,1,"New","it says acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"

"3504",21,1,1,"New","and then he goes flying down onto the ground",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3505",21,1,1,"New","um then he’s chasing the roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3506",21,1,1,"New","and he chases him into some mines ?",NA,NA,"?","21-1-1-New"
"3507",21,1,1,"New","and he starts running into the mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3508",21,1,1,"New","and it starts getting dark",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3509",21,1,1,"New","so he runs back to the beginning",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3510",21,1,1,"New","and he gets a hat",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3511",21,1,1,"New","with a light on it",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3512",21,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner is behind him",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3513",21,1,1,"New","he has a hat with the light on it",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3514",21,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner’s light is green",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3515",21,1,1,"New","and his is red",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3516",21,1,1,"New","and so when they start running through the mine",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"

"3521",21,1,1,"New","and it’s him chasing the co um the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3522",21,1,1,"New","so they’re chasing each other around and around",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"
"3523",21,1,1,"New","and around and around",NA,NA,NA,"21-1-1-New"

"3540",21,2,2,"New","this one was wile e. coyote and the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
"3541",21,2,2,"New","um it starts off with roadrunner running",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
"3542",21,2,2,"New","and coyote chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"
"3543",21,2,2,"New","and then it freezes",NA,NA,NA,"21-2-2-New"

"3705",21,3,1,"Old","and he walks out onto the rope",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"
"3706",21,3,1,"Old","and he uh goes to",NA,NA,NA,"21-3-1-Old"

"3865",3,2,1,"Old","when the roadrunner runs",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
"3866",3,2,1,"Old","instead of it working to his advantage it backfired",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"
"3867",3,2,1,"Old","and the rock ends up um catapulting him into another rock",NA,NA,NA,"3-2-1-Old"

"4101",4,2,2,"New","and then some other made up Latin",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4102",4,2,2,"New","and then start going slowly again and they take off",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4103",4,2,2,"New","and they’re running incredibly fast on the road",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"

"4107",4,2,2,"New","and just hits the ground",NA,"just",NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4108",4,2,2,"New","so he comes up with a plan",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4109",4,2,2,"New","he decides to go take a boxing glove",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4110",4,2,2,"New","put a spring in it attach the other end of the spring to a uh rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4111",4,2,2,"New","he pulls it back",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4112",4,2,2,"New","and hooks it against the rock so it won’t fly out",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4113",4,2,2,"New","until he lets go of the hook",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4114",4,2,2,"New","he hides behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4115",4,2,2,"New","he’s gonna wait for the roadrunner to come by",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4116",4,2,2,"New","and he’ll pull the hook",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4117",4,2,2,"New","the boxing glove will fly out",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4118",4,2,2,"New","and hit the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4119",4,2,2,"New","so he’s hiding behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4120",4,2,2,"New","and you hear the roadrunner coming",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4121",4,2,2,"New","and you hear him going BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4122",4,2,2,"New","and you hear the wind tearing by him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4123",4,2,2,"New","so he lets go of the hook at the right moment",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4124",4,2,2,"New","but instead of the boxing glove shooting forward the rock shoots back",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4125",4,2,2,"New","and flies him into a wall so now he’s smashed against the wall",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4126",4,2,2,"New","and then you see him look panicked",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4127",4,2,2,"New","‘cause the boxing glove flies back now",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4128",4,2,2,"New","and hits him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4129",4,2,2,"New","so he comes up with a different plan this time",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4130",4,2,2,"New","he decides he’s gonna put a tightrope between two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4131",4,2,2,"New","he’s gonna walk between them with a huge anvil in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4132",4,2,2,"New","and he’ll drop it on the roadrunner when the roadrunner walks by",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4133",4,2,2,"New","you see his blueprints and everything’s great",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4134",4,2,2,"New","so he walks on the tightrope with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4135",4,2,2,"New","but the anv but the tightrope stretches down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4136",4,2,2,"New","and now he’s on the ground on the tightrope with an anvil in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4137",4,2,2,"New","so he can’t drop it on anything",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4138",4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner comes up",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4139",4,2,2,"New","does his little BEEP BEEP",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"

"4141",4,2,2,"New","so the wil",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4142",4,2,2,"New","so the coyote throws the anvil on the ground and goes chasing after him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4143",4,2,2,"New","but when he throws the anvil on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4144",4,2,2,"New","the tightrope goes back to how it was shoots him up in the air",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4145",4,2,2,"New","but he looks kind of confident now",NA,"kind of",NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4146",4,2,2,"New","and the camera pans to the side and you see that he’s got a parachute on",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4147",4,2,2,"New","so he pulls the rope of the parachute when he starts going down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4148",4,2,2,"New","but instead of a parachute coming out random crap comes out",NA,"random crap",NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4149",4,2,2,"New","like an axe and a plate and a bowl and a spoon and a banana",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4150",4,2,2,"New","you know whatnot not a parachute",NA,"you know, whatnot",NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4151",4,2,2,"New","so he’s flying down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4152",4,2,2,"New","he looks panicked",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4153",4,2,2,"New","so he takes his acme uh aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4154",4,2,2,"New","opens it up and",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4155",4,2,2,"New","grabs a few out of the air",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4156",4,2,2,"New","‘cause you know they’re all flying straight up",NA,"you know",NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4157",4,2,2,"New","and then he just waves goodbye to the camera",NA,"just",NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4158",4,2,2,"New","as he flies down",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4159",4,2,2,"New","and hits the ground",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4160",4,2,2,"New","and there’s a little mushroom cloud",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4161",4,2,2,"New","and so this time thee roadrunner go",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"

"4164",4,2,2,"New","and he’s running after him through the mine and it gets pitch black",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4165",4,2,2,"New","so he runs back to the beginning and he grabs one of those little hats",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4166",4,2,2,"New","like those mining hats with the lights on",NA,"like",NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4167",4,2,2,"New","then the roadrunner flies up and the roadrunner has one too",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4168",4,2,2,"New","and ru roadrunner’s light is green and the coyote’s is red",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4169",4,2,2,"New","so they’re running after each other",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"

"4176",4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner gets on a uh ladder",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4177",4,2,2,"New","so the roadrunner goes up the coyote chases after him",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4178",4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner goes down on the other side",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"

"4180",4,2,2,"New","but the roadrunner stops and then goes somewhere else",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4181",4,2,2,"New","but the coyote is still running in a circle then he realizes it and stops",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4182",4,2,2,"New","runs after the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"
"4183",4,2,2,"New","the roadrunner jumps a little gap and the coyote can’t quite jump it",NA,NA,NA,"4-2-2-New"

"4647",6,1,1,"New","and he’s just laying there frustrated thinking",NA,"just",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4648",6,1,1,"New","and then he comes up with a plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"

"4650",6,1,1,"New","he puts like this metal thing around a big rock",NA,"like, thing",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4651",6,1,1,"New","and then he has a boxing glove that he attaches like a spring to it ?","mm-hmm","like","?","6-1-1-New"
"4652",6,1,1,"New","so he pulls it back so that it’s not sticking out",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4653",6,1,1,"New","so basically likeI guess he’s gonna like press a button",NA,"like, I guess, like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4654",6,1,1,"New","and the boxing glove is gonna punch the roadrunner","yeah",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4655",6,1,1,"New","and he’ll stop running",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4656",6,1,1,"New","so then he’s hiding behind the rock",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4657",6,1,1,"New","and then um the road runner is about to pass",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4658",6,1,1,"New","so he tries to get the boxing glove to do that",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4659",6,1,1,"New","so then it doesn’t do what he wants",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4660",6,1,1,"New","and instead it goes backwards",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4661",6,1,1,"New","so the rock hits him ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","6-1-1-New"
"4662",6,1,1,"New","like somehow I don’t know how that happened but the rock hits him",NA,"like, I don't know",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4663",6,1,1,"New","and then the boxing glove lets go",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4664",6,1,1,"New","and it goes backwards and hits him in the face ?",NA,NA,"?","6-1-1-New"
"4665",6,1,1,"New","so then that’s another one that he missed",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4666",6,1,1,"New","and then um so he comes up with a new plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4667",6,1,1,"New","like in front of him with his plans of what’s gonna happen",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4668",6,1,1,"New","and you see that he",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4669",6,1,1,"New","his plan is basically he’s gonna be standing on this like string",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4670",6,1,1,"New","that connects both cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4671",6,1,1,"New","and um he’s gonna drop this huge metal box thing","mm-hmm","thing",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4672",6,1,1,"New","on top of roadrunner when he passes by like down below",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4673",6,1,1,"New","and it’s gonna land on him and he’s gonna get him",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4674",6,1,1,"New","so that’s his plan in the paper so then he he sets it all up",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4675",6,1,1,"New","and he takes the metal ton",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4676",6,1,1,"New","and he star he’s about to walk with it on the string to go",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4677",6,1,1,"New","into the middle so he can drop it on roadrunner","yeah",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4678",6,1,1,"New","and then cause it’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4679",6,1,1,"New","it takes him all the way down to where the roadrunner is","right",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4680",6,1,1,"New","so by the time he gets there the roadrunner is right in front of him",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4681",6,1,1,"New","and he sees that he’s blocking his way",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4682",6,1,1,"New","so he just turns around and runs the other way ?","mm-hmm","just","?","6-1-1-New"
"4683",6,1,1,"New","and then coyote um he gets frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4684",6,1,1,"New","and drops the ton which is gonna make gravity go","yeah",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4685",6,1,1,"New","and he flies up again",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4686",6,1,1,"New","and then like he thinks he’s okay cause he has a backpack on his back",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4687",6,1,1,"New","and then um it’s a case of parachute",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4688",6,1,1,"New","so he thinks he’s okay",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4689",6,1,1,"New","and he pulls the string but it’s like disconnected",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4690",6,1,1,"New","and then all you see is like the bag open",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4691",6,1,1,"New","and forks and knives and plates like start flying up",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4692",6,1,1,"New","so he didn’t have anything to save him","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4693",6,1,1,"New","and then he takes an acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4694",6,1,1,"New","and he’s and the pills start flying up",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4695",6,1,1,"New","and he takes a bunch of then and I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4696",6,1,1,"New","’cause he knows he’s gonna be in pain or something",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4697",6,1,1,"New","so he lands on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4698",6,1,1,"New","and then um oh and then he ends up trying to find roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4699",6,1,1,"New","and he sees a place that says acme old acme mine or something ?",NA,"or something",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4700",6,1,1,"New","it’s like a coal mine","mm-hmm","like","?","6-1-1-New"
"4701",6,1,1,"New","and he sees that roadrunner went in there",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4702",6,1,1,"New","so then you know it’s dark and everything and he realizes that",NA,"you know, and everything",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4703",6,1,1,"New","so he goes back and they have these you know like construction hats ?","yeah","you know, like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4704",6,1,1,"New","the the hard ones",NA,NA,"?","6-1-1-New"
"4705",6,1,1,"New","and it has like a light on them so you can see where you’re going","mm-hmm","like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4706",6,1,1,"New","and he has a greeeen one I think",NA,"I think",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4707",6,1,1,"New","whatever one of them has a green one and one of them has a red one",NA,"whatever",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4708",6,1,1,"New","and then so he sees that roadrunner went in there",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4709",6,1,1,"New","so he’s chasing roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4710",6,1,1,"New","but it’s really hard to catch up with him because he’s so faast",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4711",6,1,1,"New","and you know they’re chasing each other around the place",NA,"you know",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4712",6,1,1,"New","but you just see like you just see like darkness kind of",NA,"just, just, like, kind of",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4713",6,1,1,"New","and like the lights running after each other",NA,"like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4714",6,1,1,"New","like you don’t actually see them running after each other","yeah","like",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4715",6,1,1,"New","so then um he ends up going the wrong way basically",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4716",6,1,1,"New","roadrunner goes another way and he goes the wrong way by mistake",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4717",6,1,1,"New","and and he’s running and running",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4718",6,1,1,"New","and then he realizes that I guess his light went out",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4719",6,1,1,"New","and he doesn’t see anything",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4720",6,1,1,"New","so he lights a match to see where he’s at",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4721",6,1,1,"New","and behind him all you see is um like",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4722",6,1,1,"New","TNT boxes dynamite and all that","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4723",6,1,1,"New","so everything gets so blown he ahk",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4724",6,1,1,"New","he ends up getting blown up",NA,NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4725",6,1,1,"New","and then you just see a sign made with cactuses that says YIPE",NA,"just",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4726",6,1,1,"New","or something like that","mm-hmm","or something",NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4727",6,1,1,"New","and that’s the end","okay",NA,NA,"6-1-1-New"
"4728",6,2,2,"New","alright so this is a roadrunner and coyote cartoon","okay",NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4729",6,2,2,"New","soo you see",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4730",6,2,2,"New","it opens where you see the desert and the road",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4731",6,2,2,"New","and then um roadrunner is running in front of coyote",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4732",6,2,2,"New","and coyote is trying to catch the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4733",6,2,2,"New","aand he’s running faster and faster trying to catch up to him",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4734",6,2,2,"New","and in his hands he has a knife and a fork",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"

"4736",6,2,2,"New","to stab him and eat him or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4737",6,2,2,"New","but right like he jumps to grab him but he misses",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4738",6,2,2,"New","and he ends up grabbing the floor instead ? with the knife and the fork",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
"4739",6,2,2,"New","and the roadrunner keeps on running",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4740",6,2,2,"New","and he’s frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4741",6,2,2,"New","but then he gets an idea",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4742",6,2,2,"New","while he’s laying on the floor with the knife and the fork",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4743",6,2,2,"New","so then he has this idea where he t takes",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4744",6,2,2,"New","there’s like this big rock like hidden from the road",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4745",6,2,2,"New","so that roadrunner won’t see",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4746",6,2,2,"New","and a metal like like a metal ring he puts around it ?",NA,"like, like","?","6-2-2-New"
"4747",6,2,2,"New","where he attaches boxing glove with a spring ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"

"4749",6,2,2,"New","the boxing glove will be held back until the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4750",6,2,2,"New","and it’ll punch him and then he’ll be you know on the floor again",NA,"you know",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4751",6,2,2,"New","so then that’s his plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4752",6,2,2,"New","he’s standing behind it",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4753",6,2,2,"New","somehow when he tries to let the boxing glove go",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4754",6,2,2,"New","instead of doing what he planned",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4755",6,2,2,"New","um the rock somehow hits him ? like he gets crashed by the rock ?",NA,"like","?, ?","6-2-2-New"
"4756",6,2,2,"New","like the rock goes backwards ?",NA,"like","?, ?","6-2-2-New"
"4757",6,2,2,"New","and then um the boxing glove instead of shooting frontwards",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4758",6,2,2,"New","it shoots backwards so it hits him in the face ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
"4759",6,2,2,"New","so he’s frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4760",6,2,2,"New","so then he comes up with a new plan um",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4761",6,2,2,"New","and you see him with like a paper like a plan of everything",NA,"like, like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4762",6,2,2,"New","and you see on the paper it it shows a picture of two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4763",6,2,2,"New","and it shows him standing in the middle",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4764",6,2,2,"New","and the he dropped this metal ton on roadrunner on the bottom",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4765",6,2,2,"New","’cause he’s on the bottom road ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
"4766",6,2,2,"New","so that’s his plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4767",6,2,2,"New","like he’s gonna make a string ? I guess it’s like a string basically",NA,"I guess, like","?","6-2-2-New"
"4768",6,2,2,"New","he’s gonna walk on the string and drop the metal ton on roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4769",6,2,2,"New","and he’ll be like you know down",NA,"you know",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4770",6,2,2,"New","so then you see him actually do it",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4771",6,2,2,"New","but he doesn’t realize that it’s not gonna work",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4772",6,2,2,"New","because then he takes the metal ton",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4773",6,2,2,"New","and he’s he’s about to start walking on the the metal on the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4774",6,2,2,"New","that connects both cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4775",6,2,2,"New","and once he starts walking on it it brings him down",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4776",6,2,2,"New","’cause of gravity ’cause it’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4777",6,2,2,"New","and he ends up being on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4778",6,2,2,"New","and right when he gets down the roadrunner is about to pass",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4779",6,2,2,"New","so then roadrunner sees that he’s in his way",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4780",6,2,2,"New","so he turns around and starts running the other way instead",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4781",6,2,2,"New","so then he’s frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4782",6,2,2,"New","and then he drops the ton ’cause he thinks he’s gonna get off the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4783",6,2,2,"New","but gravity takes him back up",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4784",6,2,2,"New","and he shoots up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4785",6,2,2,"New","but then he thinks he’s okay because he has this book bag on",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4786",6,2,2,"New","and he takes out a string I guess ’cause he thinks he has a parachute",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4787",6,2,2,"New","but it turns out the string doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4788",6,2,2,"New","and all that you see is is stuff flying up in the air",NA,"stuff",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4789",6,2,2,"New","like forks and knifes and plates and stuff like that",NA,"like, stuff like that",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4790",6,2,2,"New","and then he sees that he’s gonna go down",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4791",6,2,2,"New","so he takes out his acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4792",6,2,2,"New","and the pills start flying up",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4793",6,2,2,"New","but he manages to get a few I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4794",6,2,2,"New","because he knows he’s gonna be in pain",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4795",6,2,2,"New","and then he lands on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4796",6,2,2,"New","and then um he tries to go look for roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4797",6,2,2,"New","and he sees a a sign that says old old uh acme mine ?",NA,NA,"?","6-2-2-New"
"4798",6,2,2,"New","or something like that",NA,"or something like that",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4799",6,2,2,"New","so it’s like a coal mine",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4800",6,2,2,"New","and roadrunner is in there",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4801",6,2,2,"New","so then he starts to go in to chase him but then it’s completely dark",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4802",6,2,2,"New","so he gets scared and he goes back out",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4803",6,2,2,"New","and they have like a s a shelf with the caps you know",NA,"like, you know",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4804",6,2,2,"New","like the hardware hats the hard ones ?",NA,"like","?","6-2-2-New"
"4805",6,2,2,"New","and then um it has lights on them so you can see ahead of you",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4806",6,2,2,"New","so he takes one and roadrunner ends up having one too",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4807",6,2,2,"New","and one of them have green and one of them have red",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4808",6,2,2,"New","so they’re chasing each other around the mine",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4809",6,2,2,"New","and you just see like the lights",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4810",6,2,2,"New","you don’t actually see them ‘cause it’s dark",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4811",6,2,2,"New","but it’s hard for um coyote to keep up",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4812",6,2,2,"New","so then um he’s chasing him and he ends up going the wrong way",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4813",6,2,2,"New","like roadrunner went the other way ?",NA,"like","?","6-2-2-New"
"4814",6,2,2,"New","and he’s running",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4815",6,2,2,"New","and his light I guess went out ‘cause it’s dark",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4816",6,2,2,"New","and then he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4817",6,2,2,"New","and all you see is like dynamite and TNT boxes in the back there",NA,"like",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4818",6,2,2,"New","so then he ends up getting blown up I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4819",6,2,2,"New","‘cause then you just hear the sound",NA,NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4820",6,2,2,"New","and you see the signs made with the cactuses outside that says YIPE","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4821",6,2,2,"New","and that’s the end","nice",NA,NA,"6-2-2-New"
"4822",6,3,1,"Old","okay so this is a coyote roadrunner cartoon",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4823",6,3,1,"Old","and it opens with the desert",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4824",6,3,1,"Old","and you see roadrunner ahead of coyote running really fast",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4825",6,3,1,"Old","aand um coyote is um chasing him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4826",6,3,1,"Old","and he has a knife and a fork in his hands",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4827",6,3,1,"Old","and he’s trying to get roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4828",6,3,1,"Old","and finally um he gets closer to him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4829",6,3,1,"Old","so he makes a leap like to stab him with the knife and the fork",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4830",6,3,1,"Old","so he can eat him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4831",6,3,1,"Old","and then he misses",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4832",6,3,1,"Old","so he stabs the floor instead",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4833",6,3,1,"Old","and then c roadrunner keeps on running",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4834",6,3,1,"Old","so he’s frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4835",6,3,1,"Old","and he’s laying on the floor with the fork and the knife",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4836",6,3,1,"Old","but then he has this new idea",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4837",6,3,1,"Old","so then you see this large rock",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4838",6,3,1,"Old","that’s like hidden from where roadrunner could see when he passes by",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4839",6,3,1,"Old","and he has he puts like a metal ring around it",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4840",6,3,1,"Old","and a uh boxing glove which he attaches with a spring",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4841",6,3,1,"Old","so that the boxing glove is going to you know punch roadrunner",NA,"you know",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4842",6,3,1,"Old","as he um runs by",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4843",6,3,1,"Old","so and that’s his plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4844",6,3,1,"Old","but somehow when roadrunner is about to pass",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4845",6,3,1,"Old","the rock ends up like hitting him instead ?",NA,NA,"?","6-3-1-Old"
"4846",6,3,1,"Old","like it backs up into him somehow ?","mm-hmm","like","?","6-3-1-Old"
"4847",6,3,1,"Old","when I guess from the release of the boxing glove",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4848",6,3,1,"Old","and the boxing glove ends up hitting him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4849",6,3,1,"Old","instead it goes backwards instead of frontwards",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4850",6,3,1,"Old","soo you know that’s once again a failure",NA,"you know",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4851",6,3,1,"Old","so then he has a new plan",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4852",6,3,1,"Old","where you see him with like a plan actually planned out on paper",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4853",6,3,1,"Old","and you see that basically is gonna drop a metal ton below him",NA,"basically",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4854",6,3,1,"Old","’cause he’s gonna be in the middle of two cliffs",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4855",6,3,1,"Old","standing on a string ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","6-3-1-Old"
"4856",6,3,1,"Old","and he’s gonna drop a metal t ton below him that’s gonna run the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4857",6,3,1,"Old","and he’ll be able to get him like that",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4858",6,3,1,"Old","so then when he actually does it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4859",6,3,1,"Old","what he doesn’t realize is that gravity ’cause then um",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4860",6,3,1,"Old","he takes the metal ton",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4861",6,3,1,"Old","and he’s about to walk on um the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4862",6,3,1,"Old","and as he starts walking on it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4863",6,3,1,"Old","it brings him all the way back down to where roadrunner is",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4864",6,3,1,"Old","and by the time he’s down the roadrunner is right in front of him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4865",6,3,1,"Old","and he sees that coyote’s blocking his way",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4866",6,3,1,"Old","so he turns around and goes the other way",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4867",6,3,1,"Old","so then coyote gets frustrated again",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4868",6,3,1,"Old","and he drops the ton on the floor",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4869",6,3,1,"Old","and then he ends up shooting back up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4870",6,3,1,"Old","and then",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4871",6,3,1,"Old","but he thinks he’s okay because he thinks he has a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4872",6,3,1,"Old","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4873",6,3,1,"Old","but there it doesn’t work and then all you see is like his plates",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4874",6,3,1,"Old","and forks and knifes and all this stuff flying out of the bag",NA,"and all this stuff",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4875",6,3,1,"Old","up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4876",6,3,1,"Old","so then he realizes he’s gonna go down",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4877",6,3,1,"Old","so he takes acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4878",6,3,1,"Old","and he opens it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4879",6,3,1,"Old","and he tries to take pills as they’re flying up into the sky",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4880",6,3,1,"Old","and he takes a little bit",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4881",6,3,1,"Old","and then he falls on the ground",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4882",6,3,1,"Old","and then hee he’s he’s trying to find roadrunner again",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4883",6,3,1,"Old","and he sees the old acme mine ?",NA,NA,"?","6-3-1-Old"
"4884",6,3,1,"Old","and that’s where roadrunner is at",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4885",6,3,1,"Old","so he goes in and he’s trying to find him but it’s dark",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4886",6,3,1,"Old","so then he goes back out and there’s like a shelf at the front entrance",NA,"like",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4887",6,3,1,"Old","that has the hardware hats ? with the lights in front of them so he can see ?",NA,NA,"?, ?","6-3-1-Old"
"4888",6,3,1,"Old","so then he tries to find roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4889",6,3,1,"Old","and he’s chasing him and he’s chasing him",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4890",6,3,1,"Old","he can’t really keep up",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4891",6,3,1,"Old","and then he ends up going the wrong way",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4892",6,3,1,"Old","and um he can’t see where he’s at",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4893",6,3,1,"Old","’cause his light went out or something ?",NA,"or something","?","6-3-1-Old"
"4894",6,3,1,"Old","soo he takes a match and lights it to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4895",6,3,1,"Old","and all you see behind him is",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4896",6,3,1,"Old","the TNT and dynamite boxes and all that crazy stuff",NA,"all that crazy stuff",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4897",6,3,1,"Old","so then um he ends up getting blown up I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4898",6,3,1,"Old","’cause then you hear the sound below the ground",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4899",6,3,1,"Old","and then just you see a sign with the cactuses",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4900",6,3,1,"Old","I thought it said YIPE but maybe it says YIKES",NA,"I thought, maybe",NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4901",6,3,1,"Old","but it looked like YIPE to me","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4902",6,3,1,"Old","but that was it",NA,NA,NA,"6-3-1-Old"
"4903",7,1,1,"New","this is coyote and the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4904",7,1,1,"New","which I’m sure you know",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4905",7,1,1,"New","aand obviously the coyote was chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"

"4907",7,1,1,"New","and wants to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4908",7,1,1,"New","aand he wanted to stop the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4909",7,1,1,"New","so he tries all these different tactics",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4910",7,1,1,"New","aand hee put like a punching bags on a spring",NA,"like",NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4911",7,1,1,"New","waited for it to like punch out off a rock",NA,"like",NA,"7-1-1-New"

"4918",7,1,1,"New","like he went on a tightrope on top of a cliff",NA,"like",NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4919",7,1,1,"New","and then used a weight",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4920",7,1,1,"New","and the weight pushed him all the way to the ground",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"
"4921",7,1,1,"New","he thought he was gonna drop it on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"7-1-1-New"

"5032",8,1,1,"New","so that the roadrunner will like hit into it ?",NA,"like","?","8-1-1-New"
"5033",8,1,1,"New","but then he ends up walking across the tightrope with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"
"5034",8,1,1,"New","but then the rope falls like","on him","like",NA,"8-1-1-New"
"5035",8,1,1,"New","like he walks to the middle of it",NA,"like",NA,"8-1-1-New"
"5036",8,1,1,"New","and he’s the the rope is weighted down by the anvil","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"8-1-1-New"

"5052",8,2,1,"Old","and the coyote wants to eat the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5053",8,2,1,"Old","so he’s chasing him with a fork and a knife in his hand",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5054",8,2,1,"Old","but he can’t catch him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"

"5056",8,2,1,"Old","to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5057",8,2,1,"Old","and the first plan he comes up with is",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5058",8,2,1,"Old","with a boxing glove attached to a spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5059",8,2,1,"Old","and he’s hiding behind a rock",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5060",8,2,1,"Old","and he’s gonna let go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5061",8,2,1,"Old","and it’s gonna knock the roadrunner out",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5062",8,2,1,"Old","the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5063",8,2,1,"Old","and he lets go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"

"5065",8,2,1,"Old","and he actually gets pushed into a cliff",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5066",8,2,1,"Old","and the boxing glove punches him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5067",8,2,1,"Old","and then the second plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5068",8,2,1,"Old","to suspend an anvil from two cliffs on a tightrope ?",NA,NA,"?","8-2-1-Old"
"5069",8,2,1,"Old","and the roadrunner walks to the middle of the the tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5070",8,2,1,"Old","with the anvil and",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5071",8,2,1,"Old","but the rope is weighted down by the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5072",8,2,1,"Old","so he falls to the ground the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5073",8,2,1,"Old","ing towards him and leaves",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5074",8,2,1,"Old","and then uh he’s like he lets go of the anvil",NA,"like",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5075",8,2,1,"Old","and he’s thrown up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5076",8,2,1,"Old","and he falls back down",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5077",8,2,1,"Old","and he he I guess he has a headache or something",NA,"I guess, or something",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5078",8,2,1,"Old","and then uh the third one is when",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5079",8,2,1,"Old","they’re both in the mines",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5080",8,2,1,"Old","and the it’s really dark inside",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5081",8,2,1,"Old","they’re like caves",NA,"like",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5082",8,2,1,"Old","and they’re chasing each other around",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5083",8,2,1,"Old","the roadrunner keeps uh taunting him",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5084",8,2,1,"Old","and they keep just running around in circles",NA,"just",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5085",8,2,1,"Old","and theen um the roadrunner kinda goes away",NA,"kinda",NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5086",8,2,1,"Old","and the coyote is left in a dark room",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5087",8,2,1,"Old","so he lights a match and to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5088",8,2,1,"Old","and he’s in a room full of TNT",NA,NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5089",8,2,1,"Old","and he blows up","okay",NA,NA,"8-2-1-Old"
"5090",8,3,2,"New","okay um it’s the coyote and roadrunner story ?","yeah",NA,"?","8-3-2-New"
"5091",8,3,2,"New","and it starts off with a desert scene",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5092",8,3,2,"New","and the coyote is chasing the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5093",8,3,2,"New","with a fork and a knife",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5094",8,3,2,"New","’cause he wants to eat him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5095",8,3,2,"New","and then he can’t catch the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5096",8,3,2,"New","so he tries to come up with a plan ?",NA,NA,"?","8-3-2-New"
"5097",8,3,2,"New","aand his first plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5098",8,3,2,"New","to attach a boxing glove to a spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5099",8,3,2,"New","and then when the roadrunner passes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5100",8,3,2,"New","he’s gonna let go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5101",8,3,2,"New","and the boxing glove is gonna knock the roadrunner out",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5102",8,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner comes by",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5103",8,3,2,"New","and he lets go of the spring",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5104",8,3,2,"New","but it the thing it eventually backfires on him",NA,"thing",NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5105",8,3,2,"New","and he actually like gets thrown into the cliff backwards ?",NA,"like","?","8-3-2-New"
"5106",8,3,2,"New","and the boxing glove punches him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5107",8,3,2,"New","and the second plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5108",8,3,2,"New","to suspend a tightrope",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5109",8,3,2,"New","and like hang an anvil from it ?",NA,"like","?","8-3-2-New"
"5110",8,3,2,"New","so that when the roadrunner comes by he’s gonna hit into it",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5111",8,3,2,"New","so he walks across the tightrope with the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5112",8,3,2,"New","but then the rope is weighted down by the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5113",8,3,2,"New","so he he falls down",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5114",8,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner comes by and taunts him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5115",8,3,2,"New","and goes away",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5116",8,3,2,"New","and and uh thee coyote becomes frustrated",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5117",8,3,2,"New","he lets go of the anvil",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5118",8,3,2,"New","and he gets like thrown into the air ?","mm-hmm","like","?","8-3-2-New"
"5119",8,3,2,"New","and then he comes back down and hits the ground",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5120",8,3,2,"New","and then the third plan is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5121",8,3,2,"New","to uh go into the mines and catch him there",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5122",8,3,2,"New","’cause it’s really dark","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5123",8,3,2,"New","soo they both go into the mines",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5124",8,3,2,"New","and they’re both chasing around each other in circles",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5125",8,3,2,"New","and and the roadrunner I mean",NA,"I mean",NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5126",8,3,2,"New","the coyote can’t catch up with the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5127",8,3,2,"New","and then uh basically they chase each other around",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5128",8,3,2,"New","and the roadrunner keeps taunting him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5129",8,3,2,"New","the roadrunner goes away",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5130",8,3,2,"New","and then the coyote is left in a dark room",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5131",8,3,2,"New","and he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5132",8,3,2,"New","and there’s TNT all behind him",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5133",8,3,2,"New","and he gets blown up",NA,NA,NA,"8-3-2-New"
"5134",9,1,1,"New","uh basically I was watching the roadrunner and the coyote cartoon ?","oh okay",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5135",9,1,1,"New","alright so it starts off first where uh the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5136",9,1,1,"New","the roadrunner is running ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5137",9,1,1,"New","and the like the coyote is chasing her",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5138",9,1,1,"New","and then underneath they’re saying how the roadrunner is really really fast","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5139",9,1,1,"New","and how the coyote is like really really hungry",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5140",9,1,1,"New","so like carnivorus and and accelerator or whatever for the roadrunner","yeah","like, or whatever",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5141",9,1,1,"New","and he’s like wearing like a bib and has like a knife and a fork ?",NA,"like, like, like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5142",9,1,1,"New","and is basically chasing her",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5143",9,1,1,"New","and like all of a sudden like he he puts his fork and knife in",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5144",9,1,1,"New","like he tries to stick into her but what’s it into the roadrunner ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5145",9,1,1,"New","but it ends up hitting the ground right ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5146",9,1,1,"New","and the roadrunner runs away",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5147",9,1,1,"New","so then he’s saying he’s like gone all sad and stuff you know ?","yeah","like, and stuff, you know","?","9-1-1-New"
"5148",9,1,1,"New","and then he’s like oh I have an idea",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5149",9,1,1,"New","so it goes to the next scene basically",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5150",9,1,1,"New","where he’s trying to do one of his",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5151",9,1,1,"New","like what’s it called traps or whatever?",NA,"like, what's it called, or whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
"5152",9,1,1,"New","so basically he takes a rock right?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5153",9,1,1,"New","and he around the rock he attaches a spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5154",9,1,1,"New","and at the end of the spring there’s like a a punching glove ?","mm-hmm","like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5155",9,1,1,"New","so he thinks that if he takes the spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5156",9,1,1,"New","he takes the what’s it called the punching uh the punching glove ?",NA,"what's it called","?","9-1-1-New"
"5157",9,1,1,"New","and pulls the spring back",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5158",9,1,1,"New","connects it to the rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5159",9,1,1,"New","then when he pulls it on the string right",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5160",9,1,1,"New","when the coyote comes","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5161",9,1,1,"New","like it’s gonna go that way ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5162",9,1,1,"New","and what is it and like hit the coyote right?","okay","like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5163",9,1,1,"New","’cause it’s like a big",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5164",9,1,1,"New","like is in a canyon is like a big space over here","yeah","like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5165",9,1,1,"New","so what happens is that the roadrunner is coming",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5166",9,1,1,"New","and he lets go",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5167",9,1,1,"New","but instead of the spring going forward",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5168",9,1,1,"New","the spring pushes the rock back into him ?","mm-hmm",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5169",9,1,1,"New","and he gets crashed into a wall or whatever with the rock ?",NA,"or whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
"5170",9,1,1,"New","and then after that the what’s it called the glove comes back",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5171",9,1,1,"New","and it sta and it punches him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5172",9,1,1,"New","so that doesn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5173",9,1,1,"New","so then he’s looking at another plan",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5174",9,1,1,"New","like where he like where he takes a rope",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5175",9,1,1,"New","and he goes over a canyon above the coyote",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5176",9,1,1,"New","so the coyote’s like underneath at the bottom of the canyon",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5177",9,1,1,"New","and he has like two rocks",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5178",9,1,1,"New","and there’s like a string there",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5179",9,1,1,"New","and he’s supposed to basically like",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5180",9,1,1,"New","walk into the middle of the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5181",9,1,1,"New","with an anvil or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5182",9,1,1,"New","the acme ?","yeah",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5183",9,1,1,"New","the acme anvils",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5184",9,1,1,"New","and when the when the",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5185",9,1,1,"New","the purpose is basically that when the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5186",9,1,1,"New","I mean yeah the roadrunner when he comes",NA,"I mean",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5187",9,1,1,"New","he’s gonna drop it on her",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5188",9,1,1,"New","aand he’s like whatever she’s gonna be dead right?",NA,"like, whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
"5189",9,1,1,"New","when he starts walking down with the anvil like on the rope",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5190",9,1,1,"New","it goes down all the way",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5191",9,1,1,"New","because it’s so heavy","oh yeah",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5192",9,1,1,"New","right?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"

"5213",9,1,1,"New","he’s chasing the roadrunner into a mine ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5214",9,1,1,"New","or whatever ?",NA,"or whatever","?","9-1-1-New"
"5215",9,1,1,"New","basically like a mining area ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"

"5225",9,1,1,"New","so he starts chasing her",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5226",9,1,1,"New","and originally like the the mine is set up like this",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5227",9,1,1,"New","it has like a",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5228",9,1,1,"New","like it’s a square",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5229",9,1,1,"New","and then there are two things going out this way I think",NA,"I think",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5230",9,1,1,"New","and like one like that ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5231",9,1,1,"New","so basically he’s chasing her",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"

"5233",9,1,1,"New","like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5234",9,1,1,"New","and like it starts off slow ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5235",9,1,1,"New","and then it goes faster and faster and faster and faster",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5236",9,1,1,"New","so fast that the roadrunner gets a chance to go this way ?","uh-huh",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5237",9,1,1,"New","a different path",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5238",9,1,1,"New","and he’s still going like in circles like chasing her",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5239",9,1,1,"New","and then he realizes that she’s not there",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5240",9,1,1,"New","so he starts chasing her this way",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5241",9,1,1,"New","and then what’s it called the mine cuts into differently",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5242",9,1,1,"New","it goes like thiis and like a zigzag ?","uh-huh","like","?","9-1-1-New"

"5244",9,1,1,"New","and like long?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5245",9,1,1,"New","and then it gets smaller so it’s like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5246",9,1,1,"New","so he go like the roadrunner goes one way again",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5247",9,1,1,"New","and he goes a different way like straight",NA,"like",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5248",9,1,1,"New","she goes like up ?",NA,"like","?","9-1-1-New"
"5249",9,1,1,"New","and he’s still going like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5250",9,1,1,"New","because he’s so used to this motion ?","yeah",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5251",9,1,1,"New","and so to the point where he he gets to the end of the",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5252",9,1,1,"New","what’s it called um",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"

"5254",9,1,1,"New","what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5255",9,1,1,"New","he ha he gets to the end of the mine ?",NA,NA,"?","9-1-1-New"

"5257",9,1,1,"New","he doesn’t know what’s going on",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5258",9,1,1,"New","so he lights a match to see where he is",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5259",9,1,1,"New","and it turns out that there’s all these explosives around him ?","of course",NA,"?","9-1-1-New"
"5260",9,1,1,"New","so it just blows up the mine",NA,"just",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5261",9,1,1,"New","and on at the outside it shows the trees going to YIPES or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5262",9,1,1,"New","so the word YIPES",NA,NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"
"5263",9,1,1,"New","and then it ends so","huh nice",NA,NA,"9-1-1-New"

"5291",9,2,2,"New","he sits on the side of the canyon",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5292",9,2,2,"New","he thinks that once the roadrunner passes him",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5293",9,2,2,"New","like he ha he sets up this contraption basically",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5294",9,2,2,"New","which is a roock and it has like a spring connected to it ?",NA,"like","?","9-2-2-New"

"5296",9,2,2,"New","the end of the spring is connected to a punching glove",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5297",9,2,2,"New","so he pulls back the spring",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5298",9,2,2,"New","and connects it to the rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5299",9,2,2,"New","and he thinks that when he pulls the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-2-2-New"

"5303",9,2,2,"New","the roadrunner really really fast",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5304",9,2,2,"New","so what happens is that he’s sitting there",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5305",9,2,2,"New","and he’s waiting for the roadrunner to come",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5306",9,2,2,"New","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"

"5310",9,2,2,"New","what’s it called into whatever wall is behind him ?",NA,"what's it called","?","9-2-2-New"
"5311",9,2,2,"New","and then on top of that then like um",NA,"like",NA,"9-2-2-New"
"5312",9,2,2,"New","the glove comes back and hits him also",NA,NA,NA,"9-2-2-New"

"5398",9,3,1,"Old","so they say accelerator or whatever underneath",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5399",9,3,1,"Old","so they’re basically saying it’s fast",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5400",9,3,1,"Old","and the coyote is hungry",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5401",9,3,1,"Old","so they’re like carnivoris or whatever",NA,"like, or whatever",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5402",9,3,1,"Old","and the coyote is wearing like a bib",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5403",9,3,1,"Old","and he’s holding like a knife and a fork",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5404",9,3,1,"Old","and chasing after this like poor roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5405",9,3,1,"Old","and what’s it calledlike yeah",NA,"(what's it called, like)",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5406",9,3,1,"Old","he tries to stick his fork and knife into the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5407",9,3,1,"Old","but the roadrunner was so fast that",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5408",9,3,1,"Old","he like ch he like ends up hitting the floor",NA,"like, like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5409",9,3,1,"Old","I mean the road street I don’t know",NA,"I don't know",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5410",9,3,1,"Old","anyways",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5411",9,3,1,"Old","soo uh he’s like yeah",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5412",9,3,1,"Old","so then he’s like all upset and stuff like that",NA,"like, and stuff like that",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5413",9,3,1,"Old","so he’s like thinking and thinking",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5414",9,3,1,"Old","and he’s like oh I have an idea you know ?",NA,"like, you know","?","9-3-1-Old"
"5415",9,3,1,"Old","so the next thing that he tries to do is like",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5416",9,3,1,"Old","he has this idea where",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5417",9,3,1,"Old","he basically takes a rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5418",9,3,1,"Old","and he hooks up a spring to it",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5419",9,3,1,"Old","and the spring at the end of uh",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5420",9,3,1,"Old","the end of the spring is connected to uh a glove",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5421",9,3,1,"Old","which is like a punching glove",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5422",9,3,1,"Old","so he pulls back the spring ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
"5423",9,3,1,"Old","and hooks it onto the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5424",9,3,1,"Old","onto the rock or whatever",NA,"or whatever",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5425",9,3,1,"Old","so that when he",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5426",9,3,1,"Old","so that when he pulls the string like",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5427",9,3,1,"Old","it’s supposed to go forward and hit like the roadrunner",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5428",9,3,1,"Old","as she’s passing the canyon",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5429",9,3,1,"Old","so what happens is that he’s sitting there and waiting",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5430",9,3,1,"Old","and the roadrunner comes",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5431",9,3,1,"Old","and he pulls the string",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5432",9,3,1,"Old","but instead of going forwards ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
"5433",9,3,1,"Old","the the spring pushes the rock back",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5434",9,3,1,"Old","and squishes the coyote in the middle of the like",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5435",9,3,1,"Old","the wall and the rock",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5436",9,3,1,"Old","and then after that like uh the spring flies back",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5437",9,3,1,"Old","and the f glove hits him in the face",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5438",9,3,1,"Old","so so that didn’t work",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5439",9,3,1,"Old","so then the second plan is that basically",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5440",9,3,1,"Old","he’s gonna put a string above the canyon",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5441",9,3,1,"Old","where he’s gonna tightrope walk into the middle",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5442",9,3,1,"Old","and he’s supposed to be holding an anvil ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
"5443",9,3,1,"Old","and drop it down on the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5444",9,3,1,"Old","on the roadrunner",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5445",9,3,1,"Old","when she’s passing by",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5446",9,3,1,"Old","but when he starts walking out onto thee string ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
"5447",9,3,1,"Old","all of a sudden like he just goes down",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5448",9,3,1,"Old","because he’s so heavy",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5449",9,3,1,"Old","down to the road",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5450",9,3,1,"Old","so it ends up forming like a V-shape I guess ?",NA,"like, I guess","?","9-3-1-Old"
"5451",9,3,1,"Old","and um the the roadrunner comes up",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5452",9,3,1,"Old","and she’s like MEEP MEEP",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5453",9,3,1,"Old","like you know like teasing him basically",NA,"(like, you know), like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5454",9,3,1,"Old","and he gets all pissed off",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5455",9,3,1,"Old","and he just throws the anvil to the side",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5456",9,3,1,"Old","so the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5457",9,3,1,"Old","so the string springs him up into the air",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5458",9,3,1,"Old","and he’s like flying in the air",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5459",9,3,1,"Old","and he’s like oh I’m smart you know",NA,"like, you know",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5460",9,3,1,"Old","and he shows that he’s wearing a parachute",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5461",9,3,1,"Old","but then when he opens his parachute",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5462",9,3,1,"Old","nothing comes out except for like kitchen supplies",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5463",9,3,1,"Old","I don’t know food something like that",NA,"I don't know, something like that",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5464",9,3,1,"Old","like it was cans",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5465",9,3,1,"Old","so he’s like damn",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5466",9,3,1,"Old","and basically he takes out acme aspirin",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5467",9,3,1,"Old","’cause he knows the the fall is gonna hurt",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5468",9,3,1,"Old","and he like takes that",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5469",9,3,1,"Old","so then it cuts to the scene with thee tunnels",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5470",9,3,1,"Old","wheere he’s going into a mining tunnel I guess",NA,"I guess",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5471",9,3,1,"Old","and it’s set up that there’s a square ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
"5472",9,3,1,"Old","and two s uh two other tunnels that are connected to the square",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5473",9,3,1,"Old","and one coming down up from the ground I think",NA,"I think",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5474",9,3,1,"Old","so first he’s like chasing the roadrunner around",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5475",9,3,1,"Old","the what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5476",9,3,1,"Old","around the square mine right?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
"5477",9,3,1,"Old","and he goes like first it starts off slow",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5478",9,3,1,"Old","and then it goes like faster and faster and faster",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5479",9,3,1,"Old","basically so that they’re going in circles","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5480",9,3,1,"Old","and the roadrunner gets the chance to escape to one of the straighter mines",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5481",9,3,1,"Old","and he’s still going in circles",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5482",9,3,1,"Old","like you know",NA,"(like, you know)",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5483",9,3,1,"Old","he doesn’t realize that the roadrunner is not there",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5484",9,3,1,"Old","he’s chasing nothing",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5485",9,3,1,"Old","so then he starts what’s it called",NA,"what's it called",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5486",9,3,1,"Old","he realizes that she’s not there",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5487",9,3,1,"Old","and she st he starts following her into the other tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5488",9,3,1,"Old","and then the tunnel goes uh",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5489",9,3,1,"Old","the straight tunnel goes into like a zigzag",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5490",9,3,1,"Old","where it’s bigger and then it gets smaller",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5491",9,3,1,"Old","very very small",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5492",9,3,1,"Old","and at the end of the zigzag tunnel",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5493",9,3,1,"Old","there’s two other tunnels",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5494",9,3,1,"Old","one that’s straight and one that goes up",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5495",9,3,1,"Old","the roadrunner goes up",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5496",9,3,1,"Old","and this one goes the coyote still keeps going on the",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5497",9,3,1,"Old","like he goes on the straight one",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5498",9,3,1,"Old","but he’s still going like this",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5499",9,3,1,"Old","he’s going up and down hitting his head everywhere","mm-hmm",NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5500",9,3,1,"Old","and like he ends up in pitch black",NA,"like",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5501",9,3,1,"Old","he doesn’t know where he is",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5502",9,3,1,"Old","like you know really confused I guess",NA,"(like, you know), I guess",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5503",9,3,1,"Old","kind of dizzy I don’t know",NA,"kind of, I don't know",NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5504",9,3,1,"Old","so he lights a match",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5505",9,3,1,"Old","and he realizes that he’s next to all these explosives ?",NA,NA,"?","9-3-1-Old"
"5506",9,3,1,"Old","and they just explode in the mine",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5507",9,3,1,"Old","and then the outside of the mine says YIPES",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
"5508",9,3,1,"Old","so",NA,NA,NA,"9-3-1-Old"
